# Technical Task Registration Form

## Introduction

In this project, I created an SPA (Single Page Application) using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. I did my best to make it very close to the screenshot your provided, but I'm sure there are some improvements that can be made if I had the figma file.

### Features

- **Responsive Design:** A fluid and adaptive layout that works seamlessly across all devices.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Seamless navigation between different pages without full page reloads.
- **Form Validation:** Validate user input with built-in validation rules.
- **Internationalization:** Support both English and Arabic languages.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** A modular and reusable UI built with React components.
- **Utility-First Styling:** Rapid and consistent styling using Tailwind CSS.
- **Accessible Design:** Built with shadcn/ui, a collection of accessible and customizable UI components.
- **Type Safety:** Written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and preventing runtime errors.

### Tech Stack

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's the core of the application's front-end.
- **Vite:** A next-generation frontend build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience with hot module replacement (HMR).
- **shadcn/ui:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A highly customizable, utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs directly in your markup.
- **React Hook Form:** A library for building and validating forms in React with a focus on performance and minimal re-renders.
- **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema validation library that provides a simple and intuitive API for defining and validating data structures.
- **React Router:** A powerful and declarative routing library for React applications.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  git clone \[https://github.com/EyadOmar/go-student-order-page.git\](https://github.com/EyadOmar/go-student-order-page.git)cd your-repository
2.  npm install
3.  npm run dev

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

### Note

the stack I choose for the project is what I am very comfortable with but I could have used other stacks like:

- **HTML / CSS / JS / JQuery:** the project is not that complex and I could have used the old school stack but I chose to use React because it is a more modern and flexible framework for larger projects.
- **Bootstrap / styled components:** I chose to use Tailwind CSS because it is very easy to use inside react components without any need for additional files
- **material ui:** I chose to use shadcn/ui because it is taiwldcss compatible, if I will use styled components or just css I will preferer material ui.

### what I could have done better if I had more time
- **generate plugin:** generating pluging from the react generated file that can be used in wordpress
- **hosting: *** I could have used netlify or vercel to host the project to have a live preview for you
